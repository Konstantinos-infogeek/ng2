# ng2
> the beginning of a modular angular.js app generator

## Disclaimer: this is just a proof of concept.
> An early-stage project.
I'm working on a revamp that I'll publish as soon as it's usable.
Very likely under the same name.

## Shut up and show me how it works

### Let's get started!

Make sure you have `ng2` already installed.

1. start a barebones app using `ng2 start <appName>`
2. `cd <appName>`
3. `component install`
4. `ng2 server`

Your modular angular app will be watched, built upon changes and always running at `localhost:9000`.
